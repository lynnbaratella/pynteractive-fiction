You get to the bedroom and start looking around.
The desk is in front of you; the bed on the right.

\def\reaction{jumpyBed}[1]{
You start jumping on the bed laughing hysterically
++ Boing
++ Boing
++ Boing
++ *CRACK*

\def\scene{pencilCase}{
Nothing interesting on the desk. It's relatively clean and ordered, for once.
You notice though a suspiciously bulky pencil case.
You open it and you find, together with a ballpoint, a rubber and a pencil, a black ancient-looking ebonite fountain pen. The nib is all consumed and doesn't look like it could write, but the barrel might be wide enough to fit a message...

\def\reaction{inkyMess}[1]{
You unscrew the barrel and ink spills out, littering your hands.
++[3] Starting to flood the desk...
++[2] It's running...

++ Don't stand there looking! Stop it!

\def\reaction{washiInky}[3]{
The dim light of the sunset enters the window.
++[3] You're rubbing your hands under the water, staring at the mirror, when you suddenly realise that human consciousness is a tragic misstep in evolution.
++ We became too self-aware, nature created an aspect of nature separate from itself, we are creatures that should not exist by natural law.
++ We are things that labor under the illusion of having a self
++ an accretion of sensory experience and feeling, programmed with total assurance that we are each somebody
++ when in fact everybody is nobody.
++ Maybe the honourable thing for our species to do is deny our programming, stop reproducing, walk hand in hand into extinction...
++ You're consuming your skin, please stop now. Your hands can't get cleaner than this.

\def\reaction{end}[1]{
You're about to resume the search when you suddenly find what you were looking for.
++ Yeah, I know.
++ This fiction is awful.
